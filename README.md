Hi, my name's Madeline. I also go by Mad.

I've worked as a researcher and public librarian. I spent my teen years hacking my internet diary's 
css on a dial-up connection. After some big life changes (lots of moves! losing family! making 
more family! global pandemic!) I decided to start seriously pursuing web development.

Right now, I am interested in learning more about:
  * accessibility in web development
  * human centered design
  * data analysis and visualization
  * open source and collaborative projects

My interests outside of web development include:
  * youth advocacy
  * information literacy
  * community building
  * art and science
