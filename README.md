Hi, my name's Madeline. I also go by Mad.

I've worked as a researcher and public librarian. After some big life changes (lots of moves! losing family! making 
more family! global pandemic!) I decided to start seriously pursuing web development.

Since May 2022, I've been working through The Odin Project, and recently started LaunchCode's Java Web Development course. I also finished my MLIS. It's been a busy year.
